# Blazor WebAssembly and SkiaSharp
This is a simple Blazor WebAssembly application using SkiaSharp which is intended to be containerized. The generation of the image is not completed successfully.


The file Notes.txt shows the essence of the logs that report the error. In the same repository is included a console application that uses SkiaSharp, in net8, which demonstrates that SkiaSharp does run in a container.
